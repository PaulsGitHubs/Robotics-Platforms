## 📡 Public API Endpoints

The backend exposes a small public API for demo and integration purposes. These endpoints are intended to be safe for public access and resilient to upstream failures:

- `GET /` — basic service info and links to `/docs` and `/health`.
- `GET /health` — returns a small JSON health status (`{"status":"ok",...}`).
- `GET /api/geo/area?lat=<lat>&lng=<lng>&radius=<r>` — returns normalized coordinates for a given location.
- `GET /api/public-data/?lat=<lat>&lng=<lng>&radius=<r>` — returns a list of nearby OSM elements; if the upstream Overpass API is unavailable the endpoint returns an empty list (`[]`) and logs the error.
- `GET /api/telecom/?lat=<lat>&lng=<lng>` — returns simulated telecom nodes for demonstration.
- `GET /api/simulation/zone?lat=<lat>&lng=<lng>&radius=<r>` — runs a short simulation using public-data and telecom data and returns a `zone`, `score`, and `correlation` summary.

---

## 🧪 Tests & Development

- Added simple pytest tests for `/health` and `/api/public-data` (`backend/tests/test_endpoints.py`).
- To run tests: `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt` then `pytest backend/tests`.

---

## Changelog (unreleased)

- Robustness: `fetch_osm_objects` now handles timeouts/network errors and returns an empty list on failure to keep public endpoints stable.
- Quality: Added health and root endpoints and a small favicon handler to reduce noisy 404s.
- Tests: Added basic pytest tests for key public endpoints.
